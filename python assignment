1. definition, use cases and key features
python is a high level programming language which was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991

key features
-it is multiplatform meaning it can be used in various platforms such as windows and Linux
-it has a simple syntax similar to that of the English language
-uses an interpreter system meaning that code is executed as soon as it is written

use cases
-automation
-data science
-web development

2. installing on windows
i.Download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.
ii.Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python.
iii.Verify the installation by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing python --version.

setting up a virtual environment
i.Install the virtualenv package using pip: pip install virtualenv.
ii.Create a new virtual environment: virtualenv myenv.
iii.Activate the virtual environment: source myenv/bin/activate (on Linux/macOS) or myenv\Scripts\activate (on Windows).
iv.Verify that you are now using the virtual environment by checking the command prompt or terminal.

3. python syntax
here is a simple python syntax example

print("hello world")
This program uses the print() function to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console. The basic syntax elements used in this program are:
-Indentation: Python uses indentation to denote block-level structure. In this case, there is no indentation, as the print() function is a single statement.
-String Literals: Python uses double quotes (") to enclose string literals

4. data types and variables
-Integers: Whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, etc.
-Floats: Decimal numbers, such as 3.14, -0.5, etc.
-Strings: Sequences of characters, such as "hello", 'hello', etc.
-Boolean: Values that can be either True or False.
-List: Ordered collections of items, such as ``, ["a", "b", "c"], etc.
-Tuple: Ordered, immutable collections of items, such as (1, 2, 3), ("a", "b", "c"), etc.
-Dictionary: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, such as {"name": "John", "age": 30}, etc.

a short script to show how different data types can be used
# Integer
x = 5
print(x)

# Float
y = 3.14
print(y)

# String
name = "John"
print(name)

# Boolean
is_admin = True
print(is_admin)

5. control structures
Python has several control structures:
i.Conditional Statements: Used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.
ii.Loops: Used to execute a block of code repeatedly.
Here are examples of an if-else statement and a for loop:
# If-else statement
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")

# For loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

6. function
Functions in Python are blocks of code that executes a certain task and can be called multiple times from different parts of a program. They are useful for:
a.Code Reusability: Functions allow you to write code once and use it multiple times.
b.Modularity: Functions help organize code into smaller, manageable units.
Here is a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Example of calling the function
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)

7. lists and dictionaries
Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type. They are denoted by square brackets [] and are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation.

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are denoted by curly braces {} and are also mutable.
Here is a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both:
# Create a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

# Create a dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(person)

# Accessing elements in a list
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1

# Accessing elements in a dictionary
print(person["name"])  # Output: John

# Modifying elements in a list
numbers[0] = 10
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Modifying elements in a dictionary
person["age"] = 31
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}

8. exception handling
Exception handling in Python is used to handle runtime errors and exceptions. It consists of three blocks:
a.Try Block: The code that might raise an exception.
b.Except Block: The code that handles the exception.
c.Finally Block: The code that is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised.
Here is an example of how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors in a Python script:
try:
    x = 5 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
finally:
    print("This code is always executed.")

9.modules and packages
Modules are single files that contain Python code. Packages are directories that contain multiple modules.
To import a module in your script, you can use the import statement
example
import math
print(math.pi)

10. file I/O
Python provides several ways to read from and write to files:
i.Reading: You can read the content of a file using the open() function and the read() method.
ii.Writing: You can write to a file using the open() function and the write() method.
Here are examples of reading from and writing to a file:
# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
print(content)

# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
